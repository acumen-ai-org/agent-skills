name: dev-test-contracts
description: Verifies that a provider still honors the consumer contracts that depend on it by running pact provider verification, then normalizes the result into one contracts report fragment. Selects the verifier by provider stack (pact-js, PactNet, pact-python, pact-rust), detecting the runtime and instructing on install rather than auto-installing; an optional Pact broker can serve consumer pacts via a pinned Docker image. The fragment status is the pass/fail verdict — any failed interaction is status error. Use when checking provider/consumer contract compatibility for a release or pull request.

# dev-test-contracts

`dev-test-` Skill: it **executes** the provider against real consumer
contracts. It does not statically inspect the contract — it runs the system
and the fragment `status` is the verification verdict. The static/LLM split is
physical: `scripts/` produce the factual `metrics{}` + `body[]`;
[`references/contract-results-synthesis.md`](references/contract-results-synthesis.md)
adds the narrative. Scripts never call an LLM.

## Inputs

| Input            | Default | Notes |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----- |
| `<provider-dir>` | —       | The provider project. Its manifest selects the verifier stack: `package.json` → pact-js, `*.csproj` → PactNet, `pyproject.toml`/`requirements*.txt` → pact-python, `Cargo.toml` → pact-rust. |
| `<out_dir>`      | —       | Where the raw result and the fragment land. |
| `<pacts-dir>`    | —       | Directory of consumer pact JSON files. Not required if `PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL` is set. |
| `PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL` | unset | Optional broker serving consumer pacts instead of `<pacts-dir>`. |
| `PACT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Where the running provider is reachable (pact-python path). |

The provider must be reachable when the verifier runs — this Skill verifies a
running system. The verifier is **detected, never installed**: if the stack's
runtime is absent the runner prints the exact install line plus the pinned
broker `docker run` line and exits `3`.

`S="scripts"` below.

## Procedure

Track progress:

```
- [ ] 1. Verify       → run-pact-verify.sh → <out_dir>/pact-verify.raw.json
- [ ] 2. Normalize    → to-fragment.py     → <out_dir>/fragments/contracts.fragment.json
- [ ] 3. Validate     → validate_fragments.py (exit 0 required)
- [ ] 4. Synthesize    → contract-results-synthesis.md (enrich summary + body[])
```

### 1. Verify

```bash
bash "$S/run-pact-verify.sh" <provider-dir> <out_dir> <pacts-dir>
```

It detects the provider stack, runs that stack's pact verifier against the
consumer pacts (or the broker), and writes `<out_dir>/pact-verify.raw.json`
plus `<out_dir>/pact-verify.log`. The raw JSON carries an additive
`detected_stack` string (`pact-js` | `pact-jvm` | `pact-python` | `pact-go` |
`""` when the stack is unknown) alongside the verifier's own fields; the
existing raw shape is unchanged. The trailing `TOOL run-pact-verify exit=<n>`
line reports the outcome. Exit `3` means the verifier runtime is missing —
follow the printed install instructions, do not auto-install. Exit `4` means
the verifier ran and reported failed interactions; **continue to step 2**, the
fragment must still be written.

### 2. Normalize to a fragment

```bash
python3 "$S/to-fragment.py" contracts "<out_dir>/pact-verify.raw.json" "<out_dir>/fragments/contracts.fragment.json"
```

Emits one `category: contracts` fragment into a `fragments/` subdirectory so
the validator (step 3) sees only fragments, never the raw result or log. Every
interaction is enumerated in the "Verified interactions" table; `metrics{}`
carries the counts. `status` is the verdict: `error` if any interaction failed
(the script exits `4`), `warn` if all passed but one or more had no provider
state (or nothing was verified), `ok` if all passed and all stated. The
interactions table carries a per-section `status` mirroring that verdict
(`error` if any failed, `warn` if stateless or nothing verified, else `ok`).
After the table the script always emits a "Suggested provider verification
stack" markdown section (`status: info`, `menu: Suggested stack`): it explains
the four parts of a verification stack and names a concrete verifier picked by
a static dict keyed on the raw `detected_stack`. It is advisory — nothing is
wired this run. The fragment also carries a `help` markdown string from
[`references/report-help.md`](references/report-help.md) (the `❓` header
link), absent only if that file cannot be read.

### 3. Validate the fragment

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dev-report-framework/scripts/validate_fragments.py" "<out_dir>/fragments"
```

Point it at `<out_dir>/fragments` — the validator scans every `*.json` in the
directory, so it must see only fragments, never `pact-verify.raw.json`. Exit
`0` is the gate: only proceed when it passes. Exit `3` lists per-file contract
errors — fix and re-run step 2.

### 4. Synthesize the narrative

Follow [`references/contract-results-synthesis.md`](references/contract-results-synthesis.md)
with the validated fragment as input. It produces a one-line plain-text
`summary` and one `markdown` section to prepend to `body[]`: the verdict, the
failed interactions verbatim, and every contract verified without a provider
state. Re-validate (step 3) after merging the narrative back in.

## Outputs

- `<out_dir>/pact-verify.raw.json` — raw verifier result.
- `<out_dir>/pact-verify.log` — verifier stdout/stderr (kept for diagnosis).
- `<out_dir>/fragments/contracts.fragment.json` — the contract fragment,
  validated, with the synthesized `summary` and narrative `body[]`.

## Failure modes

- **Verifier runtime missing** → exit `3`, install line + pinned broker
  `docker run` line printed; never auto-installed.
- **Provider not running / unreachable** → the verifier reports failed
  interactions; status `error`, exit `4`. This is a real verification failure,
  not a runner break.
- **Verifier produced no / invalid JSON** → exit `2`, raw log kept; the
  verifier integration needs fixing before a fragment can be written.
- **Pacts dir absent and no broker** → exit `5`; provide `<pacts-dir>` or
  `PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL`.
- **Interaction passed with no provider state** → status `warn`; the synthesis
  role surfaces each one as a weak pass.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `0`  | Fragment written; `status` `ok`/`warn`. |
| `1`  | Bad arguments (missing positional). |
| `2`  | Verifier ran but output unparseable; raw kept for diagnosis. |
| `3`  | Verifier runtime/Docker missing; install + docker instructions printed. |
| `4`  | Verifier ran and an interaction failed; fragment written, `status: error`. |
| `5`  | Provider dir or pacts source invalid. |

`0` vs `4`: a clean run that finds a broken contract is still a successful
verification (`status: error`, exit `4`) — distinct from the runner itself
breaking (exit `2`).
